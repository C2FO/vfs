/*
Package vfs provides a pluggable, extensible, and opinionated set of file system
functionality for Go across a number of file system types such as os, S3, and GCS.

Philosophy

When building our platform, initially we wrote a library that was something to the effect of
  if config.DISK == "S3" {
	  // do some s3 file system operation
  } else if config.DISK == "mock" {
      // fake something
  } else {
      // do some native os.xxx operation
  }

Not only was ugly but because the behaviors of each "file system" were different and we had to constantly alter the
file locations and pass a bucket string (even if the fs didn't know what a bucket was).

We found a handful of third-party libraries that were interesting but none of them had everything we needed/wanted. Of
particular inspiration was https://github.com/spf13/afero in its composition of the super-powerful stdlib io.* interfaces.
Unfortunately, it didn't support Google Cloud Storage and there was still a lot of passing around of strings and structs.
Few, if any, of the vfs-like libraries provided interfaces to easily and confidently create new file system backends.

What we needed/wanted was the following(and more):
  * self-contained set of structs that could be passed around like a file/dir handle
  * the struct would represent an existing or nonexistent file/dir
  * provide common (and only common) functionality across all file system so that after initialization, we don't care
    what the underlying file system is and can therefore write our code agnostically/portably
  * use io.* interfaces such as io.Reader and io.Writer without needing to call a separate function
  * extensibility to easily add other needed file systems like Microsoft Azure Cloud File Storage or SFTP
  * prefer native atomic functions when possible (ie S3 to S3 moving would use the native move api call rather than
    copy-delete)
  * a uniform way of addressing files regardless of file system.  This is why we use complete URI's in vfssimple
  * fmt.Stringer interface so that the file struct passed to a log message (or other Stringer use) would show the URI
  * mockable file system
  * pluggability so that third-party implementations of our interfaces could be used

Install

Pre 1.17:
  go get -u github.com/c2fo/vfs/v6

Post 1.17:
  go install -u github.com/c2fo/vfs/v6


Upgrading

Upgrading from v5 to v6
With v6.0.0, sftp.Options struct changed to accept an array of Key Exchange algorithms rather than a string.
To update, change the syntax of the auth commands.
  "keyExchanges":"diffie-hellman-group-a256"
becomes
  "keyExchanges":["diffie-hellman-group-a256"]

Usage

We provide vfssimple as basic way of initializing file system backends (see each implementations's docs about authentication).
vfssimple pulls in every c2fo/vfs backend.  If you need to reduce the backend requirements (and app memory footprint) or
add a third party backend, you'll need to implement your own "factory".  See backend doc for more info.

You can then use those file systems to initialize locations which you'll be referencing frequently, or initialize files directly


  osFile, err := vfssimple.NewFile("file:///path/to/file.txt")
  s3File, err := vfssimple.NewFile("s3://bucket/prefix/file.txt")

  osLocation, err := vfssimple.NewLocation("file:///tmp/")
  s3Location, err := vfssimple.NewLocation("s3://bucket/")

  osTmpFile, err := osLocation.NewFile("anotherFile.txt") // file at /tmp/anotherFile.txt


You can perform a number of actions without any consideration for the underlying system's api or implementation details.

  osFileExists, err := osFile.Exists() // true, nil
  s3FileExists, err := s3File.Exists() // false, nil
  err = osFile.CopyToFile(s3File) // nil
  s3FileExists, err = s3File.Exists() // true, nil

  movedOsFile, err := osFile.MoveToLocation(osLocation)
  osFileExists, err = osFile.Exists() // false, nil (move actions delete the original file)
  movedOsFileExists, err := movedOsFile.Exists() // true, nil

  s3FileUri := s3File.URI() // s3://bucket/prefix/file.txt
  s3FileName := s3File.Name() // file.txt
  s3FilePath := s3File.Path() // /prefix/file.txt

File's io.* interfaces may be used directly:

  reader := strings.NewReader("Clear is better than clever")
  gsFile, err := vfssimple.NewFile("gs://somebucket/path/to/file.txt")

  byteCount, err := io.Copy(gsFile, reader)
  err := gsFile.Close()

Third-party Backends

* none so far

Feel free to send a pull request if you want to add your backend to the list.

Ideas

Things to add:
  * Add Azure storage backend
  * Provide better List() functionality with more abstracted filtering and paging (iterator?) Return File structs vs URIs?
  * Add better/any context.Context() support

Definitions

* absolute path - A path is said to be absolute if it provides the entire context need to find a file, including the
file system root. An absolute path must begin with a slash and may include . and .. directories.

* file path - A file path ends with a filename and therefore may not end with a slash.  It may be relative or absolute.

* location path - A location/dir path must end with a slash.  It may be relative or absolute.

* relative path - A relative path is a way to locate a dir or file relative to another directory. A relative path may not
begin with a slash but may include . and .. directories.

* URI - A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.
To guarantee uniformity, all URIs follow a predefined set of syntax rules, but also maintain extensibility through
a separately defined hierarchical naming scheme (e.g. http://).
