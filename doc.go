/*
Package vfs provides a platform-independent, generalized set of filesystem functionality across a number of
filesystem types such as os, S3, and GCS.

Philosophy

When building our platform, initially we wrote a library that was something to the effect of
  if config.DISK == "S3" {
	  // do some s3 filesystem operation
  } else if config.DISK == "mock" {
      // fake something
  } else {
      // do some native os.xxx operation
  }

Not only was ugly but because the behaviors of each "filesystem" were different and we had to constantly alter the
file locations and pass a bucket string (even if the fs didn't know what a bucket was).

We found a handful of third-party libraries that were interesting but none of them had everything we needed/wanted. Of
particular inspiration was https://github.com/spf13/afero in its composition of the super-powerful stdlib io.* interfaces.
Unforunately, it didn't support Google Cloud Storage and there was still a lot of passing around of strings and structs.
Few, if any, of the vfs-like libraries provided interfaces to easily and confidently create new filesystem backends.

What we needed/wanted was the following(and more):
  * self-contained set of structs that could be passed around like a file/dir handle
  * the struct would represent an existing or nonexistant file/dir
  * provide common (and only common) functionality across all filesystem so that after initialization, we don't care
    what the underlying filesystem is and can therefore write our code agnostically/portably
  * use io.* interfaces such as io.Reader and io.Writer without needing to call a separate function
  * extensibility to easily add other needed filesytems like Micrsoft Azure Cloud File Storage or SFTP
  * prefer native atomic functions when possible (ie S3 to S3 moving would use the native move api call rather than
    copy-delete)
  * a uniform way of addressing files regardless of filesystem.  This is why we use complete URI's in vfssimple
  * fmt.Stringer interface so that the file struct passed to a log message (or other Stringer use) would show the URI
  * mockable filesystem
  * pluggability so that third-party implemenations of our interfaces could be used

Install

Go install:
  go get -u github.com/c2fo/vfs/...

Glide installation:
  glide install github.com/c2fo/vfs

Usage

We provde vfssimple as basic way of initializing filesystem backends (see each implemnations's docs about authentiation).
vfssimple pulls in every c2fo/vfs backend.  If you need to reduce the backend requirements (and app memory footprint) or
add a third party backend, you'll need to implement your own "factory".  See backend doc for more info.

You can then use those file systems to initialize locations which you'll be referencing frequently, or initialize files directly


  osFile, err := vfssimple.NewFile("file:///path/to/file.txt")
  s3File, err := vfssimple.NewFile("s3://bucket/prefix/file.txt")

  osLocation, err := vfssimple.NewLocation("file:///tmp")
  s3Location, err := vfssimple.NewLocation("s3://bucket")

  osTmpFile, err := osLocation.NewFile("anotherFile.txt") // file at /tmp/anotherFile.txt


With a number of files and locations between s3 and the local file system you can perform a number of actions without any consideration for the system's api or
implementation details.

  osFileExists, err := osFile.Exists() // true, nil
  s3FileExists, err := s3File.Exists() // false, nil
  err = osFile.CopyToFile(s3File) // nil
  s3FileExists, err = s3File.Exists() // true, nil

  movedOsFile, err := osFile.MoveToLocation(osLocation)
  osFileExists, err = osFile.Exists() // false, nil (move actions delete the original file)
  movedOsFileExists, err := movedOsFile.Exists() // true, nil

  s3FileUri := s3File.URI() // s3://bucket/prefix/file.txt
  s3FileName := s3File.Name() // file.txt
  s3FilePath := s3File.Path() // /prefix/file.txt

Third-party Backends

  * none so far

Feel free to send a pull request if you want to add your backend to the list.

Ideas

Things to add:
  * Add SFTP backend
  * Add Azure storage backend
  * Add in-memory backend
  * Provide better List() functionality with more abstracted filering and paging (iterator?) Retrun File structs vs URIs?
  * Add better/any context.Context() support
  * update s3 and google sdk libs
  * provide for go mod and/or dep installs
